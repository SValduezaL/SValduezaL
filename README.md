- 👋 Hi, I’m Sergio Valdueza, currently living in Barcelona, Spain.
- 👀 I am interested in all topics related to AI, which is a very broad topic. As my knowledge grows I will be able to focus on more detailed and specific areas.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code in Python, and taking a Master in AI with INESDI Business School.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on any project in Python, and to the best of my ability.
- 📫 You can reach me by email to SValduezaL@gmail.com
